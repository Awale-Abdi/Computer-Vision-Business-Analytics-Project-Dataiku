<h1 align="center">🧥 Real-Time Winterwear Detection Using Computer Vision & Dataiku</h1>

## 📊 Overview
This solo-developed project leverages computer vision and Dataiku’s machine learning platform to detect seasonal clothing patterns—specifically winterwear—using a curated dataset of real-world images. By identifying when people begin wearing jackets, the model supports real-time business decisions in inventory planning, marketing, and supply chain agility. This project bridges machine learning and commercial insight, offering a data-driven alternative to traditional trend forecasting in the fashion industry.

## 🚀 Highlights
- Achieved **82% precision** using a **Fastest R-CNN** model within **Dataiku** after just 3 training epochs.
- Created and labeled a **balanced image dataset** (100 photos: 58 jackets, 42 non-jackets).
- Built a complete end-to-end ML pipeline: image labeling → object detection model → evaluation → strategic business reporting.
- Aligned outputs to key business functions: **inventory optimization**, **geotargeted marketing**, and **logistics responsiveness**.
- Benchmarked against industry use cases from **Zara**, **Heuritech**, and **Oracle**.

## 🧠 Business Problem
Fashion retailers traditionally rely on static forecasts and historical data to make seasonal planning decisions. These methods are often too slow to respond to real-world shifts in consumer behavior—like when people begin wearing winter clothes. This project solves that problem by detecting live changes in clothing patterns using computer vision, enabling businesses to respond in real time to emerging demand.

## 🔍 Key Features
- **Fastest R-CNN Implementation**: High-speed object detection using shared convolutional layers and RPN.
- **Dataiku Workflow**: Fully visual workflow for preprocessing, modeling, and evaluation.
- **Bias Reduction Strategy**: Deliberate dataset diversity to prevent phenotype overfitting.
- **Performance Tuning**: Iterative dataset calibration, label refinement, and model validation.
- **Strategic Reporting**: 1,500-word business insight report outlining commercial value.

## 📌 Business Applications
- **Inventory Optimization**: Adjust stock levels across regions as winterwear trends emerge.
- **Supply Chain Flexibility**: Trigger micro-batch restocks and dynamic distribution.
- **Targeted Marketing**: Launch geo-aware campaigns based on real-time image analysis.
- **Sustainability Gains**: Reduce waste by aligning production to true demand signals.

## 🏭 Industry Comparisons
- **Heuritech**: Social media image forecasting to anticipate fashion trends.
- **Zara**: AI-accelerated supply chain and demand-responsive design cycles.
- **Oracle Retail**: AI-driven analytics for assortment and planning optimization.
